## 📊 Slide 1: Cover

### ONA Platform v2.0
**Transforming Organizational Network Analysis for the Enterprise Era**

- **Company:** ONA Platform
- **Founded:** 2026
- **Stage:** Pre-Seed / Seed

## 🎯 Slide 2: The Problem

### Organizations Are Blind to Their Internal Networks

**Current Pain Points:**

1. **Fragmented Tools** - Excel, Gephi, Tableau lack integration and real-time capability
2. **No Scalability** - Desktop tools fail with >10K nodes; consultants charge $50K+ per project

4. **Static Analysis** - Monthly reports miss critical network changes happening in real-time
5. **High Barrier to Entry** - Requires PhD-level expertise; 3-6 month learning curve

### Market Validation

- **70% of Fortune 500** conduct ONA studies but lack continuous monitoring tools
- **$2.3B annual spend** on organizational consulting (McKinsey, Deloitte, Korn Ferry)
- **Average project cost:** $75K for 500-person organization (3-month engagement)

## 📝 Notes for Presenting

### Timing (12-Minute Pitch)

- Slides 1-2 (Problem): 2 minutes
- Slides 3-5 (Solution/Product): 3 minutes
- Slides 6-8 (Business/Market): 3 minutes
- Slides 9-11 (Tech/Team): 2 minutes
- Slides 12-14 (Ask/Traction): 2 minutes
- Q&A: 10+ minutes

### Key Messages to Emphasize

1. **"Organizational networks are the new black box"** - Companies have no real-time visibility
2. **"We're 80% cheaper and 10x faster than incumbents"** - Disruptive pricing + technology
3. **"Product-led growth with enterprise upside"** - Freemium funnel + $50K+ deals
4. **"Built for 100K users from Day 1"** - Not another MVP that needs to be rebuilt

### Anticipated Questions

**Q: "Why won't Microsoft/LinkedIn build this?"**
A: They focus on public graphs (LinkedIn network). ONA requires private, enterprise data with compliance. Niche enough to ignore, large enough to matter.

**Q: "How do you get customer data?"**
A: Self-serve upload (CSV, APIs) or direct DB connection (Neo4j, PostgreSQL). Customer controls all data; we never store raw emails/messages.

**Q: "What prevents customer churn?"**
A: Network effects—once analysts build dashboards and integrate data sources, switching cost is high. Also, quarterly business reviews show ROI (retention improvement, flight risk identification).

**Q: "Who's your co-founder?"**
A: Actively recruiting technical co-founder through YC Co-Founder Matching, On Deck, personal network. 3 strong candidates in pipeline.

**Q: "Why not open source?"**
A: Algorithms are open (NetworkX). Platform is proprietary SaaS. Balances community contribution with revenue protection.
